# Backend deployment and database challenge

## My deployed API URL is:
(Paste your render URL here)

## Overview
In this challenge, you will take an Express API that serves hard-coded data from a JSON file and:

1. deploy this API to render
1. create a database for the API on ElephantSQL
1. create a `users` table in your database
1. seed the table with the data from `usersData.json`
1. refactor the controllers and queries to serve data from your db
1. deploy your changes so that your API on render calls the db

See [the Detailed instructions section](#tasks) below for detailed instructions, tips, and hints.

## Getting started

1. **Fork** this repo.
1. Clone your fork to your computer.
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
1. Start the server: `npm start`

## Submitting
Submit your code as a pull request to the upstream repo.

## Routes
After each stage of the challenge, make sure that all of these routes function as expected.

- `/`: returns a `200` response: `{ data: 'Service is running' }
- `/users`: returns a `200` response in this format: `{ data: [ {//user 1...}, { // user 2, ...}, ...]}`
- `/users/:id`: returns a `200` response in this format: `{ data: { name: ..., age: ..., }}`
- `/users/:id`: returns a `404` response if the id does not exist: `{ error: 'User with id ... not found'}`

<a id="tasks"></a> ## Detailed instructions

### 1. Deploy to render
1. Deploy your API to render.
1. Make sure that all routes work.
1. **Paste your deployed URL** in the top of this README.
1. Commit your changes to the repo.

### 2. Create a database
1. Create a database on Elephant SQL
1. **Do not commit the connection string / URL to GitHub**

### 3. Create the `users` table
1. Create a `schema.sql` file in this repo that defines the table. The columns should match the keys and data types you see in the `usersData.json` file.
1. Run the schema file to create the table in your db.
1. Commit your changes.

#### Tips and hints
> The data type for `latitude` and `longitude` is **`float`**.

> Notice that the `id` data type is **`uuid`** (**not** `integer`). The primary key `id` column in the table should also be a uuid, not an integer.

- The postgresql documentation describes [what a uuid is](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-uuid.html) and [how to generate a uuid in postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-uuid.html).
- You **should** define the `id` column as `PRIMARY KEY`
- You **should** give the `id` column a `DEFAULT` value (using a function to generate a random uuid). Check out the links above.
- Unlike integer ids, uuids are random and do not increment. You should **not** use the `SERIAL` keyword in your `CREATE TABLE` statement.

</details>

You can define the `id` column inside your `CREATE TABLE` statement like this:
```
id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
```
</details>

### 4. Seed the table with the data from `usersData.json`
1. Create a `seeds.sql` file in this repo that adds at least 3 students from `usersData.json` to the `users` table.
1. The uuids in the table do not need to match the uuids in `usersData.json` (although it is possible to insert the exact ids from the JSON).
1. Commit your changes.

#### Tips and hints
> Don't waste time copy-pasting every single user from the JSON file. Just do 3 to start. Do the rest if you have time at the end.

> The `about` texts have apostrophes. (For example: `'Hi there! I'm Park...'` ). These will cause problems because SQL statments require single quotes around strings.
>
>You can escape a single quote in a SQL statement by repeating it: `'Hi there! I''m Park...'`

### 5. Serve data from the db
1. Refactor the queries and controllers to fetch from the database.
1. You will need to use `pg-promise`. It is already installed.
1. Use environment variables to store the connection string (database URL).
1. Delete the `usersData.json` file.
1. Commit your changes.

### 6. Final deployment
1. If it works locally, update your environment variables on Render, then push, merge, and deploy your code changes.
1. By the end of this step, your deployed database should serve data from the db.
